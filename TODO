[ ] SQLite backend
    [x] Install sqlite3 bindings.
    [x] Create, and update a database from irb
    [x] Design a database format -- we need to support derivations, derives + tasks, typed blobs, seeds. Support only one crawl + 1 machine
    [ ] Create and update that database format from sinatra--just a CRUD editor
    [ ] Add datetimes everywhere
[ ] Add support to run derivations of any kind based on types
[ ] Add some pre-made, hardcoded action derivations (probably thunks)
[ ] Add a task queue [but still use only 1 machine]
[ ] Write a model crawl using only hardcoded actions
[ ] Add tests and debugging methods
[ ] Show real-time view of task queue
    [ ] Fetch current list of tasks
    [ ] Update progress on each task
    [ ] Update list of tasks in realtime (ideally not polling)
[ ] Show real-time view of download progress
    [ ] Add 'completion' status for a blob + all derivations
[ ] Add HTTP fetch and cache (in DB)
[ ] Add derivations in JS
    [ ] Add support for JS language execution in ruby. Test in irb
    [ ] Add support to run a JS derivation
